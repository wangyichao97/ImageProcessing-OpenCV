# ImageProcessing-OpenCV
This is an image processing program including image preprocessing, edge detection, adding noise, filter processing, batch processing and other functions, which can help beginners learn and practice.

This work is only to meet the personal experimental needs. The project is relatively simple. I am interested in making changes on this basis.
